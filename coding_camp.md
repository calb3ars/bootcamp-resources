# Introduction
I'm glad I made the jump into programming. I've found it very rewarding and while the journey was tough, I enjoy my job and the ability to make impactful changes with my skills. In previous jobs, I was limited by what software would allow me to do and often had to manually execute repetitive tasks. Now I know that software can solve most if not all problems and if something is being repeated, you can probably write a script for it!

Software engineering is a lucrative career but it's also very challenging. You're tasked with complex problems that many people don't even want to consider or begin to start solving. Sometimes ignorance is bliss, but if you're willing to dive in, your knowledge is very powerful...

# Things to Consider:
### Experience
![alt text](http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1567095/gary-oak-pokemon-badges-sun-moon.png "Pokemon Badges")

  Do you have previous work experience that involved programming?

* If you have previous experience (contract work, developing scripts, software quality testing) that you can speak to during your job search, the post-curriculum job search will be much easier

* The best way I found for gaining experience was through website development and creating small applications

* Many of my friends from coding camp that had taken CS courses had trouble getting jobs after coding camp because people wouldn't give them a chance because they didn't have relevant work experience

* Many coding camps sugarcoat and say "Anyone can become a software developer," but the truth is it's harder to get a job without experience

### Finances
![alt text](http://www.dignited.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bills-everywhere-meme.jpeg "Bill..Bills everywhere")
##### 3 month bootcamp:
- [ ] $5000 initial deposit
- [ ] rent
- [ ] food
- [ ] entertainment
- [ ] transportation costs
- [ ] Tuition payment
(many take payment upfront, App Academy takes tuition once you get your first job, $28,000 over your first 6 months of work [initial deposit is applied to this amount])
- [ ] Job Search can take up to a year after you graduate avg is about 3 - 9 months)
- [ ] Expenses + Tuition payments while working: If you go to App Academy, losing 50 - 75% of your income for the first 6 months after you start working can really eat into your budget. Make sure to account for your high costs

# Getting into Coding Camp
![alt text](http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/simpsons-season-6.gif?w=637&zoom=2 "Clown College Simpsons")

I'd suggest gaining as much knowledge as you can about programming (the career and also programming knowledge) before you interview. Acceptance rates at good coding camps are very low (~ 4%), and you're competing against people with CS majors and others who have been studying for months!

At this point, it's important to do your research on the many coding camps out there. Chances are if it's too easy to get in, they don't have high standards and your job search will be even tougher. App Academy and Hack Reactor are two of the strongest bootcamps and their graduates still have a tough time finding jobs coming out.

Thankfully there are a few resources for interview prep:
- [ ] App Academy Bootcamp Prep (paid) <https://www.appacademy.io/bootcamp-prep/live>
* Curriculum: https://app-academy.gitbooks.io/prep-step-1/content/

- [ ] HackReactor Prep (free basic, paid additional help):
 <https://www.hackreactor.com/prep-programs/>

- [ ] Codecademy (free courses):
<https://www.codecademy.com/>

- [ ] Code School (some free courses):
<https://www.codeschool.com/>

- [ ] Udacity (some free courses):
<https://www.udacity.com/>

I had done Codecademy and a few Code School courses. I also went through App Academy's Jumpstart program (a free version of Bootcamp Prep takin on-site that teaches you CS basics in Ruby). Ruby is a very easy-to-learn language because the syntax is very forgiving and clean/easy to read. Many bootcamps use JavaScript, which is less forgiving but is widely used in professional web development.

I'd say if you have previous experience with coding or Ruby seems too easy, learn JavaScript. If you're completely new to programming, Ruby is a good introduction language. I'd also suggest learning a little bit of Python (powerful language with the elegance of Ruby's syntax ðŸ˜‰)

##### Interview Preparation
![alt text](https://www.mintteaandelephants.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/the-office-interview-meme.jpg "Dwight Interview")

It's okay to take several weeks/months to prepare for your interview. Many people prepare at night after work, so the pace of learning is a bit slower. The key is to study every day and on weekends. Consistency is going to ensure you build upon the knowledge from your previous studying session. It's like running. The more consistently you run, the better you'll get. If you try to sprint after 4 day breaks, you won't learn as much.

##### Interview Process
The interview process usually involves an online coding challenge (about an hour to complete). Make sure you've prepared adequately because you usually get one chance every 3 months.

The next step is a technical screen over Skype. You'll be presented one or two problems by your interviewer and you'll need to explain your thinking as you work through the problem. This may also involve "Pair Programming," which involves the interviewer typing as you explain instructions or the interviewer giving instructions and you typing the correct syntax. Pair Programming is an important skill that may not be natural, so make sure to get practice before the technical screen (I'm happy to explain more about Pair Programming later!). At the end of your technical screen, you'll have a chance to ask your interviewer (usually someone who's gone through the program but may not have done the job search) a few questions. These can involve the scope of the curriculum, their experience, etc. As with all interviews, the better questions you have, the better you'll seem. A key point is to seem excited for their particular program. They may also ask if you have any acceptances from other coding camps. Other acceptances can give you a better chance of getting in

If you pass the technical screen, you may have a behavioral interview with a member of the acceptance staff. The key is to be personably and ask good questions. They're usually looking to see if you're a good fit for the program and if you'll play well with others. At this point you should be 90% accepted unless you say something that raises a red flag.

# Prep Work
![alt text](http://epicpix.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Studying-is-ruff-150x150.jpg "studying corgi")

Congratulations! You got an email saying you've been accepted!!!

Before you quit your job and dream about earning truckloads of money, you're given prepwork.

This usually takes 1 month to complete and usually about 4 hrs/day. Prep work is to ramp you up for the first day (slacking on this means you'll be behind from the beginning and the entire course is at such a fast pace that it might be difficult/impossible to catch up). Just like with your interview prep, stay steady! Give the problems honest thought and don't be afraid to sketch out your ideas

# Coding Camp
![alt text](https://imgfave.azureedge.net/image_cache/1386751869252441.jpg "teachers")

Your first day of school!

I can only speak about App Academy's format, but Hack Reactor seems to be similar with fewer assessments
### Daily Schedule:
![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/eszoVAyBO2X8Q/giphy.gif "teachers")

    9am - 11am: Roll call & Morning Lecture

    11am - 12pm: Break into assigned pairs
      Pair programming through that day's assignment (told you pair programming was important!)

    12 - 1pm: Lunch break

    1 - 6pm: Roll call & Pair Programming with same partner

    6pm: Roll call & Closing announcements/end of class

    6pm - 9pm: Readings, HW Assigments, Daily Quiz

    9pm - 10pm: Commute home

    10pm - 11pm: Study/Prep for next day

### Weekly
* App Academy has weekly assessments on Mondays
  * 8 Assessments total
  * Usually cover that week's material
  * Fail 2 and you're given 1 retry
  * Fail the retry or fail 3 total assessments and you're kicked out.

### Post-curriculum (Capstone Projects)
![alt text](http://theawkwardyeti.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gall-bladder.png "Gall bladder projects")
* After the assessments were over, things actually get more stressful. You're given your Full-stack project, which is an app you build from scratch complete with a database and a frontend user interface that needs to look professional. This will be part of your portfolio, so the better you make it, the better your job search will be. Also, you have 2 weeks to complete it. Good Luck!

  * Be ready for all-nighters/late nights
  * You'll coordinate with your project manager what your MVPs (Minimum Viable Product) features will be
    * Miss too many of them and you'll receive "Job Search Strikes"
      * 5 Job Search Strikes and you're kicked out + you have to pay your tuition
  * Usually you'll clone an existing website
    * Good news: If you pick a site that has a nice interface, your project will look good
    * Bad news: Companies aren't impressed with copies of existing sites, they want employees who have the initiative to build things using their own creativity
  * My Advice: Pick a site with good functionality and a beautiful design and add features that make it your own

### Additional Projects
![alt text](https://media.makeameme.org/created/special-projects.jpg "Dr Evil Projects")
* We also built the following going into our Job Search curriculum:
  * JavaScript Game (2 week deadline + hw assignments)
  * Group Project (2 week deadline + data structures & algorithms hw)
    * Data Structures and algorithms are the hardest part if you don't have previous CS Experience
    * This combined with trying to complete a group project while being pulled into other lectures leads to high stress.
    *Pick a team that's well-rounded and that works well together
  * Data Structures & Algorithms
    * These are important for your job interviews, so learning them is important!
    * You'll be building many of the structures you use from scratch using fundamentals of Ruby/JavaScript
    * You'll also learn about new data structures that are hybrids of Arrays and Objects/Hashes. Combining these features provides the best of both worlds (lower memory usage + faster performance)
* I will say this is the most stressful part of the program. App Academy wasn't very strong with their data structures/algorithms lesson plans when I went through the program and knowing that failure can cost you tens of thousands of dollars can be very stressful.

# Job Search
![alt text](http://images.amcnetworks.com/ifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Office-Space-John-C-McGinley-e1470328075248-1920x640.jpg "The Bobs Office Space")
  * During the job search, you'll be required to submit a minimum of 25 applications/week. If you submit 25 applications, you'll receive 1 job search strike (When you receive the 5th, you're out and you have to pay tuition). If you submit 40 job applications, you don't receive any strikes. Less than 25 and you receive 2 Strikes
    * You get 1 strike removed from your record every week
  * This system is to make sure you're applying to jobs and getting yourself out there. The more applications you send, the better chance you have of getting technical screens and interviews. The more technical screens and interviews, the better chance you have of getting a job
  * It's a numbers game
  * Advice:
    * Use templates but also have a good design sense
    * Network like heck, even if it's uncomfortable
      * Buy people coffee
      * Reach out to alumni
      * Reach out to your university network
      * Attend meetups/hackathons
      * Network within your existing social groups
      * If you're shy/not strong at networking, you need to consider whether quitting your current job and investing the time and money into this career change is worth it
    * You'll get rejected countless times. Get rejected so much that you get used to it and can brush rejection off
    * It's a marathon, not a sprint. Don't burn yourself out. Get exercise, allow yourself to have fun
    * Now that you've spent thousands of dollars and months of time attending bootcamp, don't be afraid to take your bootcamp off your resume
      * There's a certain stigma associated with bootcamps, that its attendees are shortcutting their wait into software development. As unfair as that may seem, they have a point. Your goal is to prove to them that you've learned enough to contribute and that your diverse background will help (not hurt) you
      * This is where previous experience comes into play. My contract work helped me gain more interest from companies.
    * Find other places to network
        * San Francisco is saturated with bootcamp grads
        * At nearly all of my networking events, I saw classmates, alumni, and students from other bootcamps. It's very difficult to stand out from the crowd.
        * I focused my search on the Bay Area peninsula and the East Bay

# What I learned:
  * Pair Programming
  * Collaboration
  * Programming tools
  * How to Google correctly
  * 90% planning, 10% execution
  * Improved my networking skills (getting out there and promoting myself)
  * Programming foundation
    * From this, I can pick up most things pretty quickly

# What I wish I knew going in:
  * Stronger CS knowledge
    * More knowledge of principles and syntax
    * More algorithms
    * Build games on your own (Tic Tac Toe, Chess, Minesweeper)
  * How hard the job search actually was
    * Don't expect people to be impressed with your credentials
  * Experience > Knowledge
  * Importance of exercise
  * 90 - 100 hours/week can wear you down
  * Support is key (friends/family/significant others)

# Tuition
  * App Academy: $28,000

  * Hack Reactor: $17,780      <https://www.hackreactor.com/onsite-immersive#tuition-and-financing>

# JavaScript vs. Ruby
* Ruby is used for scripting and backend (database development)
  * It's helpful for learning CS principles, but also takes care of a lot of legwork for you.
  * Limitation to backend (database) development means fewer job opportunities if you're specializing in Ruby
* JavaScript is used for both backend and frontend (user interface logic) which means more job opportunities
  * More robust databases that have more users usually will use Java (very different from JavaScript) because programmers can better optimize for scale
* I'd advise focusing on JavaScript if you can pick it up without too much trouble. If you find JavaScript tough to pick up, start with Ruby.

# Next Steps:
* Decide why you want to get into programming
* Try a few tutorials on Codecademy and Code School
* Read the first 5 chapters of Eloquent JavaScript
  * <http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html>
* Try problems and see if you like it
* Read Haseeb's (App Academy Superstar) blog
  * <https://haseebq.com/why-im-becoming-a-web-developer/>
* Ruby/JavaScript Koans
  * <http://rubykoans.com/>
  * These are helpful in helping you learn how to "pass tests," which is helpful for test-driven development and passing assessments
